✅ What is Maven?
Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the process of:

Building (compiling source code)
Packaging (creating JAR/WAR files)
Dependency Management (downloading required libraries automatically)
Project Lifecycle Management (clean, compile, test, package, install, deploy)

Key Features

Convention over Configuration: Standard directory structure and lifecycle phases.
Dependency Management: Automatically downloads libraries from repositories.
Plugins: Extend functionality (e.g., compiler plugin, surefire plugin for testing).
Repositories:

Local Repository: Stored on your machine.
Central Repository: Maven’s default online repository.
Remote Repository: Custom repositories for organizations.




✅ What is pom.xml?
pom.xml (Project Object Model) is the core configuration file for a Maven project. It defines:

Project Information: Name, version, description.
Dependencies: External libraries your project needs.
Plugins: Tools for building, testing, packaging.
Build Settings: Custom configurations.
Repositories: Where to fetch dependencies from.

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

Important Tags

<groupId>: Unique ID for your organization/project.
<artifactId>: Name of the project/module.
<version>: Version of the project.
<packaging>: Type of output (jar, war, pom).
<dependencies>: List of required libraries.
<build>: Build-related configurations.
<repositories>: Additional repositories.


✅ What are Artifacts?
An artifact in Maven is any file produced or used during the build process. Common artifacts:

JAR: Java Archive (compiled code).
WAR: Web Application Archive.
POM: Project Object Model file.
Source JAR: Contains source code.
Test JAR: Contains test classes.

Artifact Coordinates
Artifacts are uniquely identified by:

groupId
artifactId
version
packaging

Example:
com.example:my-app:1.0.0:jar


✅ Maven Lifecycle

Clean: Removes previous build files.
Validate: Checks project structure.
Compile: Compiles source code.
Test: Runs unit tests.
Package: Creates JAR/WAR.
Install: Installs artifact in local repo.
Deploy: Pushes artifact to remote repo.


✅ Why Maven is Important for You (DevOps Context)
Since you’re learning DevOps, Maven is crucial because:

It integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
Automates build and dependency management.
Works well with artifact repositories like Nexus or Artifactory.
