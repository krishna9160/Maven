✅ What is Maven?
Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the process of:

Building (compiling source code)
Packaging (creating JAR/WAR files) 
Dependency Management (downloading required libraries automatically)
Project Lifecycle Management (clean, compile, test, package, install, deploy)

Key Features

Convention over Configuration: Standard directory structure and lifecycle phases.
Dependency Management: Automatically downloads libraries from repositories.
Plugins: Extend functionality (e.g., compiler plugin, surefire plugin for testing).
Repositories:

Local Repository: Stored on your machine.
Central Repository: Maven’s default online repository.
Remote Repository: Custom repositories for organizations.




✅ What is pom.xml?
pom.xml (Project Object Model) is the core configuration file for a Maven project. It defines:

Project Information: Name, version, description.
Dependencies: External libraries your project needs.
Plugins: Tools for building, testing, packaging.
Build Settings: Custom configurations.
Repositories: Where to fetch dependencies from.

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

                             http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

Important Tags

<groupId>: Unique ID for your organization/project.
<artifactId>: Name of the project/module.
<version>: Version of the project.
<packaging>: Type of output (jar, war, pom).
<dependencies>: List of required libraries.
<build>: Build-related configurations.
<repositories>: Additional repositories.


✅ What are Artifacts?
An artifact in Maven is any file produced or used during the build process. Common artifacts:

JAR: Java Archive (compiled code).
WAR: Web Application Archive.
POM: Project Object Model file.
Source JAR: Contains source code.
Test JAR: Contains test classes.

Artifact Coordinates
Artifacts are uniquely identified by:

groupId
artifactId
version
packaging

Example:
com.example:my-app:1.0.0:jar

✅ Maven Lifecycle

Clean: Removes previous build files.
Validate: Checks project structure.
Compile: Compiles source code.
Test: Runs unit tests.
Package: Creates JAR/WAR. (.m2 is the root forlder for maven)
Install: Installs artifact in local repo.
Deploy: Pushes artifact to remote repo.


✅ Why Maven is Important for You (DevOps Context)
Since you’re learning DevOps, Maven is crucial because:

It integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
Automates build and dependency management.
Works well with artifact repositories like Nexus or Artifactory.

✅ What is a Maven Plugin?

A plugin is a collection of goals that perform tasks during the Maven build lifecycle.
Examples:

maven-compiler-plugin → Compiles Java source code.
maven-war-plugin → Packages a WAR file for web applications.
maven-surefire-plugin → Runs unit tests.
maven-deploy-plugin → Deploys artifacts to a remote repository (like Nexus).

✅ Why Plugins Are Important

Maven has a lifecycle (clean → compile → test → package → install → deploy).
Each phase is executed by a plugin goal.
Without plugins, Maven cannot build, test, or package your project

In Maven, a goal is a specific task that a plugin performs during the build process.

✅ What is a Goal?

A goal is the smallest unit of work in Maven.
Each plugin contains one or more goals.
Goals are bound to phases in the Maven lifecycle, or you can run them directly.


✅ Examples of Goals

From maven-compiler-plugin:

compile → Compiles main source code.
testCompile → Compiles test source code.


From maven-war-plugin:

war → Packages the project into a WAR file.


From maven-clean-plugin:

clean → Deletes the target directory.




✅ How Goals Relate to Phases

Maven lifecycle phases (like compile, package, install) are collections of goals.
When you run:
Shellmvn packageShow more lines
Maven executes all goals bound to the package phase (e.g., compile, test, war).


✅ Run a Goal Directly
You can run a goal without a phase:
Shellmvn compiler:compileShow more lines
Here:

compiler = plugin
compile = goal
